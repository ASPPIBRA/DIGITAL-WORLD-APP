                        <h4>Origin of coffee</h4>

                    <p>
                        Coffee has the scientific name of Coffea sp, belonging to the Rubiaceae family, 
                        which gives it the characteristic of a bush, measuring between 2 and 5 meters in height, presenting a woody stem, 
                        a green trunk when young and brown during the adult phase, in addition to of persistent and ribbed leaves, which generate the coffee beans.
                    </p>

                        <h4>Historical coffee path</h4>
                        
                    <p>
                        The beginning of the grain's history is not precise, but there is a legend about a shepherd from Abyssinia, 
                        present-day Ethiopia, who, around the year 800, noticed that his goats became willing and bouncy when eating reddish yellow fruits. 
                        After chewing their food, the animals were full of energy and walked miles and miles over steep terrain.
                    </p>
                    <p>    
                        The pastor reported the fact to a monk, who decided to try the fruit infusion and found that the drink 
                        helped to stay awake for prayers and long hours of study. The news spread and generated a demand for the product. 
                        Evidence shows that coffee was first cultivated in the Islamic monasteries of Yemen.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Due to the Islamic religion, which does not allow the consumption of alcoholic beverages, coffee soon spread to 
                        religious cults in the Arabian region, from which the name coffee came, qahwa, in Arabic, which means wine. The fruit was first roasted in Persia. 
                        The Arabs maintained a monopoly on the product until the 16th century. But, from 1615, the grain started to be savored in the European continent, 
                        taken by travelers after their incursions to the East.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Europe's interest in the drink led the Dutch to smuggle in fresh fruit and start planting in their colonies in Asia (Java, Ceylon and Sumatra) in 1699. 
                        In the meantime, the French were presented with a coffee tree and started planting on the islands of Sandwich and Bourbon. From there, 
                        Europeans brought seedlings of the plant to their colonies in Latin America.
                    </p>

                        <h4>Coffee arrives in Brazil</h4>

                    <p>

                        The arrival of coffee in Brazil is attributed to the sergeant-major, Francisco de Melo Palheta. In 1727, he would have received an assignment 
                        from the governor of Maranhão to visit French Guiana and obtain a seedling of the fruit, which had become a product of high commercial value at the time. 
                        To achieve success, the officer gained the trust of the wife of the governor of the capital of French Guiana. At the end of the trip, 
                        the first lady offered him an Arabica coffee seedling, which he brought to Belém do Pará hidden in his luggage.
                    </p>
                    <p>    
                        The climatic conditions in Brazil were favorable and coffee cultivation soon spread to other states. 
                        The Tijuca forest in Rio de Janeiro was the starting point for large plantations, which spread to 
                        Angra dos Reis (RJ), Paraty (RJ) arriving in São Paulo through the city of Ubatuba. It didn't take long for the coffee plantations to occupy the Paraíba Valley, 
                        then Campinas (SP), the region of Ribeirão Preto (SP), extending to the States of Minas Gerais and Paraná. In 1830, the grain was already the main product of Brazilian exports. 
                        Coffee boosted the economic development of Brazil, in particular, the State of São Paulo, which built new railroads, Sorocabana and Mogiana, to transport the goods to the Port of Santos.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The strength of coffee growing in the center-south of Brazil was shaken by a frost in 1870, which caused serious damage. 
                        Almost 60 years later, in 1929, coffee growing suffered a new shock. The crash of the New York Stock Exchange forced the 
                        federal government to burn millions of bags of coffee to avoid an even bigger crisis. The episode marked the end of the heyday of the coffee cycle, 
                        which ran from 1800 to 1929. After that, coffee plantations were re-established in Minas Gerais, São Paulo, Espírito Santo, 
                        Paraná and today are present in 15 states of Brazil. Coffee is no longer Brazil's main export product, but it is one of the 
                        most prominent commodities in foreign sales within the agribusiness segment.

                        <h3>Varieties of Coffee Beans.</h3>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Coffee comes in many varieties and is produced in different parts of the world, each with its own flavor profile and distinctive 
                        characteristics. Arabica and Robusta are the two main species, with Arabica known for its mild flavor and Robusta for its robust flavor and higher caffeine content. 
                        Some of the best known names are also Bourbon, Catuaí and Novo Mundo. Different growing regions and processing methods also contribute to the diversity of coffee flavors, 
                        ranging from fruity and floral to nutty and chocolatey.

                    <p class="my-4">
                        Each type of grain has its own characteristics that may or may not please the palate of each consumer. 
                        Knowing what these differences are, the choice process becomes easier given the range of options that the market offers. 
                        In general, the final result of coffee flavor and aroma, for example, depends on numerous factors, from the choice of planting 
                        location to the drying and roasting processes of the grain. Of course, in addition to this natural variety, 
                        coffee is very versatile and allows combinations with different types of drinks and recipes, from traditional espresso to creamy cappuccino. 
                        The red coffee fruit is thanks to genetic variability, which made it possible to develop varied coffee beans.

                    <p>
                        Including, many varieties are derived from Arabica - considered the most consumed type. 
                        See each variety in detail below:

                    <li>
                        Robusta: The Robusta variety has a rustic appearance and a pronounced flavor, 
                        with great resistance to diseases and a longer maturation time than Arabica. 
                        Representing just a quarter of the world's coffee production, Robusta is most 
                        commonly found in the form of freeze-dried coffees and blends.

                        On the palate, this variety has a very present and marked bitterness, 
                        due to the large amount of caffeine (about 2.2%) and the low presence of sugar (from 3% to 7%).
                    </li>    
                    <li>
                        Arabica: The most produced and consumed variety in the world, Arabica coffee has a pure and smooth flavor, 
                        it is naturally sweeter and a little acidic. In addition, it is rich in health benefits, since, 
                        by receiving a light roast, Arabic grains preserve the plant's antioxidants more intensively.
                    </li>

                        Bourbon: Bourbon coffee is very common and its intense aroma is complemented by a slightly sweet taste. 
                        In general, it offers a smooth drink. It is produced a lot in the south of Minas Gerais.

                        Catuaí: One of the main coffee varieties in Brazil, the Catuaí type coffee is the result of crossing the Novo Mundo and Caturra types. 
                        Its main characteristic is its natural sweetness and it has a good yield for the producer. 
                        It is produced in virtually all regions of Brazil.

                        <h4>What are the most produced coffee beans in Brazil?</h4>

                    <p class="my-4">    
                        As a matter of habit and custom, Brazilians consume mixed Arabica and conilon coffee beans. 
                        Our country leads as one of the largest coffee producers and exporters in the world ranking. 
                        Of all the states, Minas Gerais is the one that most produces and exports coffee, in addition 
                        to covering practically half of the national production. Currently, the most produced coffee 
                        beans in Brazil are Arabica and Conilon (or Robusta). Arabica coffee and conilon coffee varieties 
                        come from natural mutations or genetic improvement. Normally, Brazilians consume mixed Arabica and 
                        conilon coffee beans. However, Arabica coffee has found space among gourmet coffee lovers because 
                        it is slightly acidic and sweet. The conilon grain, on the other hand, has chocolate nuances and is 
                        perfect as instant coffee.
                    </p>                        
                    <li>
                        Novo Mundo: With a striking flavor and smooth aroma, Novo Mundo is often used in darker roasts, 
                        as it is usually fuller and sweeter than the others. Variety that has adapted in most producing regions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Caturra: Caturra coffee is commonly found in the Serra do Caparaó region, in Minas Gerais. 
                        Possibly created from a mutation of the Bourbon variety, it has a smaller size, larger, 
                        wider and new leaves, a green color and high production in the first harvests. Common in the Yellow and Red varieties, 
                        Caturra delivers a drink of excellent quality, as it is practically 100% Bourbon coffee.
                    </li>    
                    <li>
                        Acaiá: Acaiá is a natural mutation from Mundo Novo, that is, it is 100% Arabica. 
                        Participating in the set of new varieties, it is considered a rare coffee. 
                        This grain has more pronounced characteristics when grown at high altitudes, from 800 meters above sea level. 
                        As a characteristic, this grain has fruits with much larger seeds, compared to other varieties, 
                        in addition to good productivity. In the cup, Acaiá, has fruity notes and a smooth flavor, 
                        with memories of chocolate and medium acidity.

                        <h5>Step by Step to Start Coffee Planting</h5>

                        Despite being a plant that resists well to different climatic conditions, the coffee tree needs some specific care to develop 
                        properly and offer very high quality beans, especially when it comes to cultivation for commercial purposes. 
                        We remind you that when working with coffee plantations for commercial purposes, the quality of the coffee is the differential 
                        to obtain or not a good demand from customers. Coffee shops, for example, will want high quality beans to offer their customers, 
                        even if it costs a little more.
                        
                        <h5>Choose the Location for the Coffee Plantation</h5>
                        
                        The first step to start your coffee plantation is to choose a suitable place for the plantation. Taking this into account, 
                        try to avoid land facing faces that are prone to strong and cold winds, as this characteristic is highly harmful to plants. 
                        The site must not have received the cultivation of coffee plantations within a period of 5 years, 
                        as this condition favors the appearance of diseases and pests. The coffee plantation develops more easily in places that have a flat topography, 
                        because, if it is steep, it can make the sowing and harvesting processes more laborious. 
                        The soil must also be fertile and well-draining and should be avoided if it is very eroded or stony.
                        
                        <h5>Prepare the Soil for Coffee Growing</h5>

                        Even observing all the indicated points to choose a place for coffee plantation, it will hardly be completely perfect, 
                        being necessary to correct the errors. First, it is recommended to fix soil erosion, for this, use a crawler tractor, 
                        which is capable of leveling the terrain, eliminating holes and making it flat. This will allow seeding to be carried out more quickly, 
                        in addition to harvesting, of course. Next, you have to take care of the nutritional issues of the soil. 
                        Do a superficial cleaning to remove all impurities that are visible. Did the site receive another crop within 1 year? In this case, 
                        it is indicated to plow the land, grinding the remains that will be quickly decomposed and converted into fertilizer.
                        
                        <h5>Select the Diversities for the Coffee Plantation</h5>
                        Is the soil impeccable to receive the new crop? Well, now is the time to select the diversity of coffee that will be planted. There are more than 100 species of coffee around the world, but only 3 types of beans are among the most cultivated and consumed. Among the main coffee varieties is Mundo Novo, which has been genetically improved, has a high degree of productivity and is large in size, being the most recommended for those who are starting to grow coffee.
                        The Bourbon Vermelho coffee, which is small in size and produces small red beans, with average productivity, and the Híbrido Catuaí coffee, which was obtained by crossing Novo Mundo and Caturra, with medium size, small beans and average productivity. It is interesting to try each of the grains, including sampling for people, so you will know which is the most suitable for planting in your region, achieving the best performance when selling the goods.

                        <h4>Sow the Coffee Plantation</h4>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After choosing the seeds, it is necessary to sow the coffee. At this stage, start digging holes approximately 30 cm deep and 25 cm wide. Each hole should be spaced 80 cm apart, which is enough for one bush not to interfere with the growth of the other. The ideal is to place between 2 and 3 seeds inside each hole, then cover them with 2 layers of soil. Finish the seeding process by watering the beds to speed up plant germination. With regard to irrigation, take special care not to water too much, as this will soak the plant and prevent germination.
                        Cultural Treatments of the Coffee Plantation
                        Growing coffee requires special care to produce high quality fruit. First of all, you need to keep the beds moist, so irrigate the plantation at least once a week. However, you need to be careful not to end up soaking the soil, this will bring you financial losses. The land is also subject to the appearance of weeds and pests, which can hinder the development of plants. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out fortnightly inspections to verify the appearance of these external agents and subsequently eliminate them. If the degree of pests is very high, it is recommended to apply pesticides in low quantities so as not to harm the grains.

                        <h4>Coffee plantation harvest.</h4>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The coffee trees are ready for harvest when they have medium-sized grains, and the plantation must be 20% green. This process can be done completely manually or mechanically. The coffee has to be detached from the branches, removing all the lint. Also, care must be taken when handling the grains to prevent them from being bruised, losing their flavor and becoming unusable for consumption.
                        How to choose the most productive grain?
                        Currently, in Brazil, we find more than 130 varieties of coffee crops in the National Cultivars Registry (RNC). Around 90% of coffee growing in Brazil has been made with varieties from IAC, Mundo Novo and Catuaí, since the 50s and 70s, thanks to their tolerance to stress and resistance to diseases. The answer to identify the most productive and resistant grain is full of unknowns, so it is important to pay attention, since the development and productivity of a coffee plantation depends on genetic improvement (or variety) and the environment, such as climate, soil and production system.
                        Some tips are essential to maintain good production in crops. First, pay attention to the size of the variety — whether it is short, medium or tall — and also keep an eye on the vigour, the crown diameter, the maturation cycle, resistance to pests and diseases, the quality of the beverage and the grain size. This is necessary for the variety to fit in with the coffee production system, increasing the grain's fertile potential.
                        How to change the environment for higher production?
                        Some tricks can be applied to the environment to increase the production of coffee beans. One of the main changes you can make is to add compounds to give the soil greater fertility (just be careful with pesticides, which can cause environmental damage). In addition, management is essential. Pay attention to the pruning and do what the coffee tree requests according to the time of year, such as more or less spaced cuts. Irrigation is also controllable, so purchase equipment to keep the coffee trees hydrated at all times.

                    <p>
                        Investing in coffee cultivation can be financially rewarding. The value per hectare depends on factors such as location, infrastructure and cultivation techniques. With proper care, a coffee plantation can yield crops for decades, generating consistent income. However, it is important to note that success requires meticulous attention to factors such as soil quality, pest control and market trends.
                        with data collected by UNESP, the implantation and maintenance of a coffee plantation will cost around R$14,000.00 per hectare, and with the irrigation procedure, it will be possible to harvest up to 150 bags of coffee. Translating this information into monetary values, the gross income for each hectare of coffee will range from R$15,000.00 to almost R$23,000.00, depending on the planting method used, with or without the irrigation procedure
                        in production increased by 3.7% and, therefore, currently has 389.2 thousand hectares and average productivity of 43.6 bags per hectare, a performance that indicates a small increase of 0.4% in relation to the average productivity of coffees of the species conilon from the previous year.
                        The data and numbers that allowed this analysis to be carried out were obtained from the Coffee Executive Summary – March 2022 and the Gross Production Value – VBP – February 2022, studies of the coffee sector that are elaborated and released monthly by the Agricultural Policy Secretariat – SPA, from the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Supply – Mapa, whose editions are available in full at the Café Observatório do Consórcio Pesquisa Café, coordinated by Embrapa Café.
                        Based exclusively on data from the Gross Production Value - VBP, if a ranking is also established, in this case, of the revenue from coffee growing in the five Brazilian geographic regions, it can be noted that the Southeast Region occupies the first place with R$ 63.82 billion, which is equivalent to 89% of total revenues, followed by the Northeast Region with R$ 4.1 billion (5.7%). In third place comes the North Region with an estimated revenue of R$ 2.37 billion (3.3%), in fourth place the South Region with R$ 844.7 million (1.2%). And, finally, the Midwest Region, which has gross revenue from the coffee crop estimated at BRL 566.77 million, an amount that corresponds to 0.8% of the VBP of Cafés do Brasil in 2022.

                        In the accumulated 11 months of the 2022/23 crop year, Brazilian coffee exports reached 32.977 million bags, down 9.7%
                        In the accumulated result for the year up to May, Brazil exported 13.6 million bags of coffee, representing a drop of 19% compared to the same period of the previous year.
                        This result reflects a slower start to the harvest and the shortage of coffee due to two smaller harvests. According to the monthly statistical report by the Brazilian Coffee Exporters Council (Cecafé), in May, Brazilian coffee exports totaled 2.448 million 60 kg bags, generating foreign exchange revenue of US$ 544.8 million.
                        17.7% of Brazil's total exports in the first five months of 2023, totaling 2.398 million bags.
                        The maritime complex of Santos (SP) continues to be the main point of export of Brazilian coffee, representing 76.4% of the total.
                        The ports of Rio de Janeiro and Paranaguá (PR) occupy the second and third place, respectively.

                        You know that little coffee left over in the morning or the grounds that remain in the coffee filter? The idea that these residues can be used as fertilizer in vegetable gardens and home crops is increasingly widespread. And the good news is that in fact these organic materials so common in everyday life can bring benefits to your plants. Including increasing their production.
                        Today, we bring you four benefits of using coffee grounds in your garden plants, using even more organic waste for your crops, avoiding unnecessary buildup and encouraging reuse. Check out:
                        If mixed with soil, sludge helps maintain permeability, soil drainage and support beneficial microorganisms for plant development. If the soil is well drained, the roots develop and penetrate more easily.
                        The fermented coffee grounds are rich in nitrogen and help soil microorganisms to develop, serving as food for the plant.
                        Coffee can help retain moisture, and it also protects the soil from the impact of watering or rain.
                        Covering the soil with coffee is also good to prevent invasive or spontaneous weeds from appearing.

                    </p>
                    <p>Coffee is a drink currently produced from the infusion of the beans produced by the coffee tree. To make the drink, we use the roasted seed, which is sold in the form of grains or already ground.
                        This drink is known for its stimulating role, an effect associated with caffeine, a substance that:
                        leaves us in a greater state of alert;
                        favors our ability to concentrate;
                        improves performance on simple tasks; It is
                        decreases tiredness and drowsiness.
                        In addition to caffeine, coffee is rich in antioxidants and other biologically active substances, which makes its consumption beneficial in many situations. Currently, it is recognized, for example, that coffee consumption is associated with:
                        a reduction in the incidence of Parkinson's and the risk of developing type II diabetes;
                        neuroprotective role in the development of Alzheimer's;
                        protection against the development of liver cirrhosis, especially alcoholic cirrhosis;
                        lower chance of developing usual asthma symptoms than those who do not consume the drink;
                        prevention of some types of cancer;
                        reduced risk of suicide;
                        increased thermogenesis, which induces weight loss, and caffeine is responsible for this effect.
                        Although caffeine is responsible for beneficial actions in the body, its consumption in high doses or by people sensitive to the substance can produce negative effects. Among the symptoms caused by excess caffeine, we can mention tachycardia, insomnia, anxiety, headache, tremors, nausea and palpitations.

                        APRIL 14
                        In 2005, the ABIC (Brazilian Coffee Industry Association) together with the IOC (International Coffee Organization), established that April 14 would be celebrated as World Coffee Day. most consumed beverage in the world, second only to water. However, this is a “world celebration” celebrated in Brazil.
                        MAY 24TH
                        On May 24th, not only is National Coffee Day celebrated, but also the day of the barista, who is the professional specialist in the preparation of coffee-based drinks. The 24th of May was made official by the Brazilian Association of the Coffee Industry (ABIC) in 2005, with it entering the scene symbolizing the opening season of harvests in most of the producing regions of the country. An important observation is that each country celebrates national coffee day on a different date: in the US and England it is on September 29th; in Indonesia it is on August 17th; in Germany it is on September 24th and in Japan it is on October 1st, next to International Day.
                        OCTOBER 1ST
                        Finally, on October 1st, we have International Coffee Day. Therefore, this is a global celebration due to the existence of many coffee lovers around the world. In short, the date was chosen in 2015 by the International Coffee Organization (ICO), with the aim of unifying celebrations around the world, this is a date celebrated worldwide.
                        Coffee's journey from its humble beginnings in Ethiopia to becoming a global phenomenon is a testament to its enduring appeal. Upon arriving in Brazil and prospering, coffee shaped economies, landscapes and cultures. From its diverse varieties to its economic importance, coffee remains a source of inspiration, investment and innovation, while being celebrated on platforms like LinkedIn, connecting coffee enthusiasts across the globe.
